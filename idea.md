Animal Kingdom: Create a website that explores different animals from around the world. Each animal can have three properties, such as overview, habitat, and behavior. Featured animals: You could create a page for each featured animal, such as elephants, lions, hippos, zebras, and so on. Each page could include an overview of the animal, information on its internal structure (such as its anatomy, diet, and behavior), and surface geology (such as its habitat, range, and conservation status).

    Regional focus: You could organize the website by region, highlighting the different animals that are native to each area. For example, you could have a page for the animals of the savannah, the animals of the rainforest, and the animals of the desert.

    Multimedia content: Including multimedia content such as photos, videos, and audio recordings could help users to get a better understanding of these animals and their environments. You could also feature virtual reality or 360-degree videos to provide users with a more immersive experience.

    Educational resources: Including educational resources such as lesson plans, quizzes, and printable activities could help educators and parents to use the website as a teaching tool. These resources could be tailored to different age groups and learning levels.

Interactive map: You could create an interactive map of Africa, with icons or images of each animal placed on the map according to their natural habitats. Users could click on each icon or image to be directed to the animal's individual page. Start with an interactive map of Africa, which can be created using tools such as Google Maps or Leaflet. You can also use a plugin or a pre-made template to create the map. Place icons or images of each animal on the map according to their natural habitats. For example, you can place a lion icon in the savannah, a hippo icon in the rivers, and an elephant icon in the forests. When users click on an icon or image, they should be directed to the individual page for that animal. You can use hyperlinks or buttons to achieve this. You can also add other interactive features to the map, such as zooming in and out, and hovering over the icons or images to reveal more information about each animal.
